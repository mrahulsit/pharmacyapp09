- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tool that provides a fast development server and optimized production builds.

**Backend:**

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

## Getting Started

### Frontend Setup

To get started with the frontend:
